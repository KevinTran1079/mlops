# mlops

The purpose of the repository is to develop skills needed to deploy machine learning algorithms and models into production.

- FastApi
- Docker
- Kubernetes (K8s) for scaling
- CI/CD
- Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

# Learning Goals

- Practice building APIs with FastAPI
- Gain experience in model serialization and loading
- Containerize ML apps with Docker
- Deploy containerized apps to the cloud
- Manage deployment with Kubernetes
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

# Bank Note Authentication API

This is a containerized FastAPI application that predicts whether a bank note is real or fake using a trained random forest.

```

Access API docs at: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

---

## Docker Instructions

### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t banknote-api .
```

### Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 banknote-api
```

The API will be accessible at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## API Usage

### Endpoint: `POST /predict`

**Request JSON body:**

```json
{
  "variance": 2.3,
  "skewness": 1.1,
  "curtosis": -0.4,
  "entropy": 0.9
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "prediction": "Fake note"
}
```

---

## Model Info

The model (`clf.pkl`) is a pre-trained binary classifier built using scikit-learn. It takes four features from bank note data:

- Variance
- Skewness
- Curtosis
- Entropy

---

## TODOs

- [ ] Add model training script
- [ ] Add logging and error handling
- [ ] Add tests with `pytest`
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (e.g., Render, AWS)
